  productHi resq 1 ; to store the high quadword in case of overflow

arithmetic:
  ; ask for the first integer
  xor rbx, rbx
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, firstprompt
  call printf

  ; scan the first integer
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, unsignedlongintegerformat ; tell scanf what data format to expect
  mov rsi, firstint
  call scanf

  ; confirm
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, entered
  mov rsi, [firstint] ; pass it once for decimal representation
  mov rdx, [firstint] ; and again for hex representation
  call printf

  ; ask for the second integer
  xor rbx, rbx
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, secondprompt
  call printf

  ; scan the second integer
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, unsignedlongintegerformat ; tell scanf what data format to expect
  mov rsi, secondint
  call scanf

  ; confirm
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, entered
  mov rsi, [secondint] ; decimal representation
  mov rdx, [secondint] ; hex representation
  call printf

  ; multiply them
  mov rax, [firstint]
  imul qword [secondint] ; multiply secondint with firstint, result stored in rdx:rax
  mov [productHi], rdx ; get the top 64-bit number from rdx
  mov [productLo], rax ; get the bottom 64-bit number from rax

  jo overflowed ; if there was an overflow, jump to the handler labeled 'overflow'

  ; output the result
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, resultmsg
  mov rsi, productstr
  mov rdx, [productLo] ; only output the low quadword because there was no overflow
  mov rcx, [productLo] ; this time do it in hex
  call printf

  jmp division ; unconditionally jump to the division section

overflowed:
  ; output the hex representation of the 128-bit result
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, overflowmsg ; the string to output is the overflow message
  mov rsi, [productHi] ; first the high quadword
  mov rdx, [productLo] ; then the low
  call printf

division:
  ; do the division
  ; imul treats the dividend as a 128-bit integer composed of rdx:rax
  ; since we want the dividend to be 64-bits, we'll only set rax and zero out rdx
  ; this makes rdx:rax == rax
  mov qword rax, [firstint]
  mov qword rdx, 0
  idiv qword [secondint]
  mov [quotient], rax ; get the quotient from rax
  mov [remainder], rdx ; get the remainder from rdx

  ; output the quotient
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, resultmsg
  mov rsi, quotientstr
  mov rdx, [quotient] ; in decimal form
  mov rcx, [quotient] ; and in hex form
  call printf

  ; output the remainder
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, resultmsg
  mov rsi, remainderstr
  mov rdx, [remainder] ; in decimal
  mov rcx, [remainder] ; and hex
  call printf

  ; say goodbye
  mov qword rax, 0
  mov rdi, goodbye
  call printf

  ; exit
  xor rax, rax ; if we got here then assume success, zero out rax to indicate this
  ret
