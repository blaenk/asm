Purpose: introduce the harmonic series

Harmonic Series is defined as the infinite series of numbers from n = 1 to infinity where 1/n.
It is described as divergent, because as the number of terms n increases, the sum grows slower.
This quality is apparent in the sample runs, where, as the input limit increased, so did the running time,
seemingly exponentially.

The algorithm utilizes the x87 FPU stack, and the stack is structured such that the top (st0)
will always store the current term as it is being computed, st1 stores the total sum up to that point, st2 stores
the user-input limit, and st3 stores the number 1.0.

On each iteration, the term number n (i.e. 3) is pushed on the stack. st3 (1.0) is divided by that number at
the top of the stack and stored in-place at st0. That result is then added to st1, the total sum, and then it (st0)
is popped from the stack so that the total sum is the top of the stack. The top is then compared to the user-input
limit at what is now st1. If the total is greater than the limit, then the term number has been found. Otherwise,
it loops to apply another partial sum.
